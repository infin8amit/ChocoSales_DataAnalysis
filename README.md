## Introduction

This project involves a comprehensive data analysis using Excel to derive insights and answer various business questions. The analysis covers quick statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), sales analysis, anomaly detection, and profitability assessment.

## Quick Statistics

Summarize the key statistics derived from the data, such as:

- Total Sales
- Average Sales per Country
- Number of Products Sold
- Total Profit

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Conditional Formatting

Performed EDA using Excel's conditional formatting to highlight:

- High and low sales values
- Trends over time
- Outliers

## Sales by Country (with Formulas)

Calculated sales by country using formulas:

- SUMIFS: Used to aggregate sales data by country.
- AVERAGEIFS: To find average sales by country.
- COUNTIFS: To count the number of sales transactions per country.

## Sales by Country (with Pivots)

Used Pivot Tables to summarize sales data by country:

- Created Pivot Tables to aggregate sales data.
- Applied filters and slicers for dynamic analysis.
- Generated charts to visualize sales distribution.

## Top 5 Products by $ per Unit

Identified the top 5 products by sales per unit:

- Sorted the products by sales per unit.
- Used formulas like RANK and LARGE to find the top products.
- Created charts to visualize the top products.

## Anomalies in the Data

Detected anomalies in the sales data:

- Used statistical functions to find outliers.
- Applied conditional formatting to highlight anomalies.
- Verified anomalies by cross-referencing with other data points.

## Best Sales Person by Country

Identified the best sales person for each country:

- Used Pivot Tables and formulas like MAX to find the top sales person.
- Created charts to visualize the performance of salespersons.

## Profits by Product

Calculated profits by product:

- Used the products table to find profit margins.
- Applied formulas to calculate total profits.
- Created charts to visualize profit distribution by product.

## Dynamic Country-level Sales Report

Created a dynamic sales report at the country level:

- Used Pivot Tables and slicers for dynamic filtering.
- Created dashboards to present the sales data interactively.

## Products to Discontinue

Identified products to discontinue based on:

- Low sales volume
- Low profit margins
- Negative growth trends


### Formulas and Functions

- **SUMIFS**: Summed up sales data based on multiple criteria.
- **AVERAGEIFS**: Calculated average sales by applying multiple conditions.
- **COUNTIFS**: Counted the number of sales transactions that met specific criteria.
- **RANK**: Ranked products based on sales per unit.
- **LARGE**: Identified the top values in a data set.
- **IF**: Applied conditional logic to identify anomalies.

### Pivot Tables

- Created Pivot Tables for data summarization and analysis.
- Used slicers and filters for dynamic data exploration.
- Generated Pivot Charts to visualize data.

### Conditional Formatting

- Applied conditional formatting to highlight key insights.
- Used color scales, data bars, and icon sets to visualize data trends and outliers.

## Conclusion

Identified products to discontinue based on a comprehensive analysis considering multiple factors, including:

- **Demand across Different Geographies**: Analyzed sales data to determine the demand for each product in various regions.
- **Sales Volume**: Evaluated the total sales volume to identify underperforming products.
- **Profit Margin**: Assessed the profit margins to ensure profitability.
- **Impact on Other Sales**: Considered how each product affects the sales of other products, including complementary and substitute relationships.
- **Customer Attraction**: Evaluated if the product is responsible for driving customer footfall and overall store traffic.

The decision to discontinue a product was not made based on a single parameter but rather on a holistic view of all these aspects to ensure an informed and strategic approach.
